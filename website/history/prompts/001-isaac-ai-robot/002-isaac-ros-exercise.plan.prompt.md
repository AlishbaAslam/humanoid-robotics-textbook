## Prompt

Create a comprehensive Exercise 2 document for the Isaac ROS educational module. The exercise should cover Isaac ROS VSLAM and Navigation implementation with hands-on activities for students to practice implementing Isaac ROS components for humanoid robot navigation.

## Response Snapshot

Created a comprehensive Exercise 2 document for Isaac ROS implementation covering:
- Complete hands-on exercise with 5 tasks
- VSLAM configuration and setup
- Navigation integration with Navigation2
- Implementation and testing procedures
- Performance validation methods
- Troubleshooting guidelines
- Assessment questions

The exercise guides students through implementing a complete Isaac ROS navigation system with VSLAM, perception integration, and navigation components, providing practical experience with GPU-accelerated robotics software.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete hands-on exercise created for Isaac ROS implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Exercise covers all major Isaac ROS components with validation steps
- 📁 Files: spec, plan, checklists, and exercise document created/updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Exercise provides comprehensive practical experience with Isaac ROS

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All exercise components properly structured
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase
