# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) module, where you'll learn about the middleware that enables communication between different components of robotic systems. This module will guide you through the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, how to integrate Python agents with ROS 2 systems, and how to model humanoid robots using URDF.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll cover three main areas:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding Nodes, Topics, and Services
2. **Python Agent Integration** - Connecting AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
3. **URDF Modeling** - Creating humanoid robot descriptions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- Beginner to intermediate robotics developers
- AI engineers looking to integrate with robot hardware
- Anyone interested in the middleware layer of robotic systems

Let's begin by exploring the foundational concepts of ROS 2!
