# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin Simulation module! This module focuses on building digital twins with physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering in Unity, including sensor simulations.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors the real-world object's behavior, characteristics, and responses. In robotics, digital twins play a crucial role in developing, testing, and validating robot behaviors in a safe, cost-effective virtual environment before deploying to real hardware.

This module covers three core areas:

1. **Physics Simulation and Environment Building in Gazebo** - Learn how to create realistic physics simulations that accurately represent how robots interact with their environment
2. **High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity** - Explore how to create visually realistic representations of robots and environments for human interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) and Integration** - Understand how to simulate various sensors to provide realistic sensory input for perception algorithms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up Gazebo for physics simulation of robotic systems
- Create high-fidelity visualizations using Unity for robotics
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) with realistic noise models
- Integrate simulation environments to create comprehensive digital twin systems
- Apply digital twin concepts to real-world robotics applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of coordinate systems and transformations

Let's begin exploring the world of digital twin simulation for robotics!
