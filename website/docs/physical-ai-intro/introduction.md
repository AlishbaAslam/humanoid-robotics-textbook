# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI embodies intelligence in robots and other physical devices that can interact with their environment. This field combines machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and control systems to create autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks in unstructured environments.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence is the concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. Rather than processing information in isolation, embodied systems learn and adapt through sensorimotor experiences. This approach recognizes that the body and environment are integral to cognitive processes, leading to more robust and adaptive AI systems that can handle real-world complexity.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots offer unique advantages in human-centered environments. Their human-like form factor enables natural interaction with spaces and tools designed for humans. By studying humanoid robotics, we explore how humans perform complex tasks and translate these capabilities into artificial systems, advancing both robotics and our understanding of human intelligence.

## Course Theme

This course bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robots, teaching students how to create intelligent systems that can operate in the real world. Students will develop an autonomous humanoid robot capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and executing complex tasks using advanced AI techniques.

## Module Overview

- **Module 1: ROS 2** - Robot Operating System framework for building robot applications with communication, hardware abstraction, and tooling
- **Module 2: Gazebo + Unity** - Simulation environments for testing and validating robot behaviors in virtual worlds before real-world deployment
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - GPU-accelerated platform for developing AI-powered robots with perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities
- **Module 4: VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** - Integration of visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action for human-robot interaction

## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI is revolutionizing industries from manufacturing to healthcare, creating robots that can work alongside humans safely and effectively. As AI systems become more integrated into our physical world, understanding how to design, build, and deploy embodied intelligence is crucial for the next generation of engineers and researchers.
