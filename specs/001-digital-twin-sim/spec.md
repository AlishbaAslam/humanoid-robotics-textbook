## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Physics Simulation and Environment Building in Gazebo (Priority: P1)

As a robotics student or engineer, I want to learn how to create physics simulations in Gazebo so that I can build realistic environments for my robot to operate in. This chapter will teach me how to set up Gazebo, create 3D environments, configure physics properties, and integrate with ROS for robot simulation.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational component of digital twin technology - without proper physics simulation, the digital twin cannot accurately represent the real-world robot's behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up a basic Gazebo simulation environment with a robot model, running physics simulations, and verifying that the robot behaves according to physical laws. This delivers the core value of understanding physics simulation in robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh ROS/Gazebo installation, **When** I follow the tutorial steps, **Then** I can create a basic environment with a robot model that responds to physics correctly
2. **Given** a robot model in URDF format, **When** I load it into Gazebo, **Then** it appears with proper physics properties and can be controlled via ROS topics

### User Story 2 - High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity (Priority: P2)

As a robotics student or engineer, I want to learn how to create high-fidelity visualizations in Unity so that I can create immersive digital twin experiences with realistic lighting, materials, and human-robot interaction interfaces. This chapter will teach me how to set up Unity for robotics visualization, create realistic 3D models, and implement user interfaces for robot control.

**Why this priority**: This provides the visual component of the digital twin that allows users to observe and interact with the simulation in a realistic environment, which is essential for human-robot interaction studies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a Unity scene with realistic rendering of a robot model, implementing basic controls, and verifying that the visual quality meets high-fidelity standards. This delivers the value of understanding advanced visualization in robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robot model, **When** I import it into Unity with proper materials and lighting, **Then** it renders with high visual fidelity and realistic appearance
2. **Given** a Unity scene with a robot, **When** I implement user interface controls, **Then** I can interact with the robot visually in real-time

### User Story 3 - Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) and Integration (Priority: P3)

As a robotics student or engineer, I want to learn how to simulate various sensors in both Gazebo and Unity so that my digital twin can accurately replicate the sensory input of a real robot. This chapter will teach me how to configure and test LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU sensors in simulation environments.

**Why this priority**: Sensor simulation is crucial for developing perception algorithms and ensuring that the digital twin provides realistic sensory data that matches real-world robot sensors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up simulated sensors in Gazebo/Unity, verifying that they produce realistic data, and confirming that the data matches what would be expected from real sensors. This delivers the value of understanding sensor simulation in robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robot with simulated LiDAR, **When** I run the simulation, **Then** the LiDAR produces realistic point cloud data similar to real LiDAR sensors
2. **Given** a robot with simulated depth cameras, **When** I run the simulation, **Then** the camera produces realistic depth images with proper noise and distortion characteristics

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the simulation environment contains complex physics scenarios that might cause instability?
- How does the system handle different sensor configurations and ensure realistic noise models?
- What if the user has limited hardware resources that can't run high-fidelity rendering?
