## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - VLA Educational Content Creation (Priority: P1)

A robotics engineer or AI developer accesses the educational module to learn about Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. The user wants to understand how to integrate voice commands, cognitive planning, and robotic action execution in autonomous systems. They expect to find practical examples, technical explanations, and implementation guidance that they can apply to their own projects.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the educational module - providing comprehensive learning materials for the target audience.

**Independent Test**: The educational module can be accessed and consumed by users, delivering knowledge about VLA systems with clear explanations and examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a robotics engineer visits the educational module, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand how to implement VLA components in robotic systems
2. **Given** an AI developer starts the module, **When** they complete all three chapters, **Then** they can describe how to implement VLA components in robotic systems after reading

### User Story 2 - Voice-to-Action Learning (Priority: P1)

A user interested in voice-controlled robotics accesses the "Voice-to-Action" chapter to learn how to implement voice command systems using OpenAI Whisper. They want to understand the technical concepts and see practical examples of converting speech to robotic actions.

**Why this priority**: Voice-to-action is a key component of VLA systems and represents one of the main chapters of the educational module.

**Independent Test**: The voice-to-action chapter can be read and understood independently, providing practical knowledge about implementing voice command systems.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user reads the Voice-to-Action chapter, **When** they study the examples, **Then** they understand how to use OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
2. **Given** an AI developer follows the chapter content, **When** they implement a voice command system, **Then** they can successfully translate speech to robotic actions

### User Story 3 - Cognitive Planning Implementation (Priority: P1)

A robotics engineer accesses the "Cognitive Planning" chapter to learn how to use LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions. They want to understand how to bridge human language with robotic commands.

**Why this priority**: Cognitive planning is a core component of VLA systems and represents a significant chapter of the educational module.

**Independent Test**: The cognitive planning chapter can be consumed independently, teaching users how to translate natural language into robotic actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user reads the Cognitive Planning chapter, **When** they study the examples, **Then** they understand how to use LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
2. **Given** a robotics engineer implements the concepts, **When** they test the system, **Then** the system successfully translates natural language commands to ROS 2 actions

### User Story 4 - Capstone Project Understanding (Priority: P2)

A user completes the capstone project chapter to understand how all VLA components work together in an autonomous humanoid robot. They want to see a comprehensive example that integrates voice-to-action and cognitive planning.

**Why this priority**: The capstone project demonstrates the integration of all concepts learned in previous chapters.

**Independent Test**: The capstone project chapter can be read independently, showing how to build an autonomous humanoid using VLA principles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user reads the Capstone Project chapter, **When** they follow the implementation guide, **Then** they understand how to build an autonomous humanoid robot using VLA components

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the educational content is accessed by users with different technical backgrounds?
- How does the module handle users who only need specific chapters rather than the complete module?
- What if users cannot access external documentation links referenced in the module?
