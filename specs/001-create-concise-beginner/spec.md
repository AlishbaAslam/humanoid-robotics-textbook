## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Student accesses introductory chapter (Priority: P1)

As a student beginning a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, I want to read a concise, beginner-friendly introduction chapter that explains key concepts and provides a clear roadmap of what I'll learn, so I can understand the fundamentals and be prepared for the course.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational material that sets up the entire course experience and provides students with essential context.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student read the chapter and demonstrate understanding of Physical AI concepts, course modules, and weekly expectations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with no prior knowledge of Physical AI, **When** they read the introduction chapter, **Then** they can explain what Physical AI and embodied intelligence mean in simple terms
2. **Given** a student preparing for the course, **When** they review the chapter, **Then** they can identify the four main modules (ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) and understand their importance

### User Story 2 - Student reviews weekly breakdown (Priority: P1)

As a student enrolled in the course, I want to see a clear weekly breakdown of topics and learning objectives, so I can plan my study schedule and understand the progression of the course.

**Why this priority**: This provides essential structure and expectations that help students succeed in the course.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student review the weekly breakdown and explain what they'll learn each week.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reviewing the course structure, **When** they read the weekly breakdown, **Then** they can identify what topics are covered in each week (1-13)
2. **Given** a student planning their study time, **When** they reference the weekly breakdown, **Then** they can allocate appropriate time for each module

---

### User Story 3 - Student understands capstone project (Priority: P2)

As a student taking the course, I want to understand the capstone project requirements and goals, so I can see how all the modules connect to a practical application.

**Why this priority**: This provides motivation and context for the entire course by showing how the concepts connect to a practical outcome.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student explain the capstone project and how it integrates the course modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reviewing the capstone description, **When** they read about the Autonomous Humanoid project, **Then** they can explain how it incorporates the four main modules
