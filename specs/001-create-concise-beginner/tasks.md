# Tasks: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Chapter

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-concise-beginner/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `src/content/docs/` at repository root
- **Chapter content**: `src/content/docs/physical-ai-intro/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project structure for Physical AI textbook chapter
- [X] T002 [P] Create directory structure at src/content/docs/physical-ai-intro/
- [X] T003 [P] Set up basic markdown file structure for chapter

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core content infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Define content structure and layout for one-page chapter
- [X] T005 [P] Set up basic markdown formatting and styling approach
- [X] T006 Create content outline based on specification requirements

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Student accesses introductory chapter (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create a concise, beginner-friendly introduction chapter that explains key concepts and provides a clear roadmap of what students will learn

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student read the chapter and demonstrate understanding of Physical AI concepts, course modules, and weekly expectations

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T007 [P] Create Physical AI and embodied intelligence definitions section
- [X] T008 [P] Create course theme section explaining bridge between digital AI and physical robots
- [X] T009 Create module overview section with brief summaries of ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA
- [X] T010 Create "Why Physical AI Matters" section
- [X] T011 Create "What Students Will Learn" section with 6-8 bullet points
- [X] T012 Create weekly breakdown section for Weeks 1-13 with 1-2 bullets per week
- [X] T013 Create capstone project summary section for Autonomous Humanoid
- [X] T014 Format content to fit within one page with clean headings and bullet points
- [X] T015 Review content for student-friendly language and clarity

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Student reviews weekly breakdown (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure the weekly breakdown is clear and provides adequate guidance for students to plan their study schedule

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student review the weekly breakdown and explain what they'll learn each week

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T016 Validate weekly breakdown content for clarity and accuracy
- [X] T017 Ensure weekly progression flows logically from basic to advanced concepts
- [X] T018 Review weekly breakdown for appropriate level of detail (not too detailed, not too vague)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Student understands capstone project (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure the capstone project description clearly connects to all course modules

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student explain the capstone project and how it integrates the course modules

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T019 Validate capstone project description for clarity and connection to modules
- [X] T020 Ensure capstone project description motivates student engagement
- [X] T021 Review capstone description for appropriate complexity level

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T022 [P] Review entire chapter for consistency in tone and style
- [X] T023 [P] Verify content fits within one-page constraint
- [X] T024 [P] Check all content is beginner-friendly and avoids technical jargon without context
- [X] T025 [P] Validate formatting for Docusaurus compatibility
- [X] T026 Run final review for academic tone and educational value

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify content fits within one page constraint
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
