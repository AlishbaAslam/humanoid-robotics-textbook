# Plan Quality Checklist: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Chapter

**Purpose**: Validate plan completeness and architectural quality before proceeding to tasks
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [specs/001-create-concise-beginner/plan.md](specs/001-create-concise-beginner/plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on architectural decisions and approach
- [x] Written for technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Architecture Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Architecture decisions have clear rationale
- [x] Key components and interfaces identified
- [x] Non-functional requirements addressed
- [x] Implementation approach is clear
- [x] Technology-agnostic where appropriate
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] All architecture decisions support the feature requirements
- [x] Components can be developed independently
- [x] Interfaces are well-defined
- [x] Plan meets measurable outcomes defined in spec

## Notes

- All items have been validated and the plan is ready for task generation.
