# Tasks Quality Checklist: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Chapter

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and execution readiness before implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [specs/001-create-concise-beginner/tasks.md](specs/001-create-concise-beginner/tasks.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on executable work items
- [x] Written for implementation teams
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Task Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Tasks are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Task dependencies are clearly defined
- [x] Complexity estimates are provided
- [x] All acceptance criteria are defined
- [x] Tasks follow logical sequence
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] All tasks have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Tasks can be executed independently where possible
- [x] Dependencies are properly sequenced
- [x] Tasks align with architectural plan
- [x] No implementation details leak into task descriptions

## Notes

- All items have been validated and the tasks are ready for implementation.
