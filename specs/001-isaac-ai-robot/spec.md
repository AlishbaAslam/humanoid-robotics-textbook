## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation (Priority: P1)

As a robotics engineer or AI developer, I want to learn how to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for creating photorealistic simulations and generating synthetic data so that I can train my robot perception systems in realistic virtual environments before deploying to the real world. This chapter will teach me how to set up Isaac Sim, create realistic environments, configure physics properties, and generate synthetic datasets for AI model training.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational component of the AI-Robot Brain - without realistic simulation and synthetic data generation, the AI systems cannot be properly trained and validated before real-world deployment. Isaac Sim provides the photorealistic simulation capabilities that are essential for creating robust perception systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up an Isaac Sim environment, creating a realistic scene, generating synthetic data, and verifying that the data quality is suitable for AI model training. This delivers the core value of understanding how to leverage photorealistic simulation for robotics development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh Isaac Sim installation, **When** I follow the tutorial steps to create a photorealistic environment, **Then** I can generate synthetic sensor data that closely matches real-world characteristics
2. **Given** a robot model in Isaac Sim, **When** I configure synthetic data generation parameters, **Then** I can produce diverse datasets with realistic variations and annotations for AI training

### User Story 2 - Isaac ROS: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM and Navigation (Priority: P2)

As a robotics engineer or AI developer, I want to learn how to use Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated visual SLAM and navigation so that I can implement efficient perception and navigation systems that leverage NVIDIA's GPU acceleration capabilities. This chapter will teach me how to set up Isaac ROS components, configure VSLAM algorithms, and integrate them with navigation systems.

**Why this priority**: This provides the perception and navigation capabilities that form the "brain" of the robot - the ability to understand its environment and navigate through it efficiently. Isaac ROS enables hardware acceleration that is crucial for real-time performance in autonomous systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up Isaac ROS components, running VSLAM algorithms on sample data, and verifying that the system can accurately map environments and navigate through them using hardware acceleration. This delivers the value of understanding how to implement efficient perception and navigation systems.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sensor data from a robot equipped with cameras and other sensors, **When** I process it through Isaac ROS VSLAM components, **Then** I can generate accurate 3D maps and track the robot's position in real-time
2. **Given** a known environment, **When** I run Isaac ROS navigation components, **Then** the robot can plan and execute collision-free paths using GPU-accelerated processing

### User Story 3 - Nav2: Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoid Movement (Priority: P3)

As a robotics engineer or AI developer, I want to learn how to use Nav2 for path planning specifically adapted for bipedal humanoid movement so that I can implement navigation systems that account for the unique locomotion characteristics of humanoid robots. This chapter will teach me how to configure Nav2 for bipedal locomotion, implement dynamic path planning, and handle humanoid-specific navigation challenges.

**Why this priority**: This provides specialized navigation capabilities for humanoid robots, which have unique locomotion requirements compared to wheeled or tracked robots. Proper path planning for bipedal movement is essential for humanoid robot autonomy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring Nav2 for bipedal humanoid parameters, running path planning algorithms, and verifying that the planned paths are suitable for stable bipedal locomotion. This delivers the value of understanding specialized navigation for humanoid robots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot in an environment with obstacles, **When** I use Nav2 path planning adapted for bipedal movement, **Then** the robot can navigate while maintaining balance and stability appropriate for bipedal locomotion
2. **Given** dynamic obstacles in the environment, **When** I run Nav2 with humanoid-specific parameters, **Then** the robot can replan paths while considering its bipedal kinematic constraints

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the synthetic data generation encounters complex lighting conditions that are difficult to simulate accurately?
- How does the system handle dynamic environments where objects are moving and changing, requiring real-time updates to perception and navigation?
- What if the GPU acceleration hardware requirements exceed available resources, and how can the system adapt?
- How does the navigation system handle challenging terrain that requires complex bipedal locomotion patterns?
