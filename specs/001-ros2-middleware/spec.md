## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals Learning (Priority: P1)

A beginner robotics developer wants to understand the core concepts of ROS 2 including Nodes, Topics, and Services to build a foundation for more advanced robotics development.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge required before moving on to more advanced topics like Python agent integration and URDF modeling.

**Independent Test**: User can explain the difference between Nodes, Topics, and Services, and create simple publisher/subscriber examples after completing Chapter 1.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user with basic Python knowledge, **When** they complete Chapter 1, **Then** they can create a simple ROS 2 node that publishes and subscribes to messages
2. **Given** a user following the exercises in Chapter 1, **When** they run the provided code examples, **Then** they observe successful message passing between nodes
3. **Given** a user attempting the Chapter 1 exercises, **When** they encounter the service example, **Then** they can create and call a simple ROS 2 service

### User Story 2 - Python Agent Integration with ROS 2 (Priority: P2)

An AI engineer wants to integrate Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 systems using the rclpy library to control robot hardware and process sensor data.

**Why this priority**: This bridges the gap between AI software and robotics hardware, which is essential for practical applications.

**Independent Test**: User can create a Python script that acts as a ROS 2 node and successfully communicates with other nodes in the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user with Python and basic ROS 2 knowledge, **When** they complete Chapter 2, **Then** they can create a Python agent that subscribes to sensor data and publishes control commands
2. **Given** a user following the rclpy integration exercises, **When** they run their Python agent, **Then** it successfully communicates with other ROS 2 nodes
3. **Given** a user working on the Chapter 2 exercises, **When** they encounter error handling scenarios, **Then** they can implement proper error handling in their Python agents

### User Story 3 - Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF (Priority: P3)

A robotics developer wants to understand how to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to prepare for simulation and control.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for creating realistic robot models that can be used in simulation and control systems.

**Independent Test**: User can create a URDF file that describes a simple humanoid robot and visualize it in a ROS 2 environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user with basic understanding of robot kinematics, **When** they complete Chapter 3, **Then** they can create a URDF file describing a simple humanoid robot
2. **Given** a user following the URDF modeling exercises, **When** they load their URDF in RViz, **Then** they can visualize the robot model correctly
3. **Given** a user completing the final simulation exercise, **When** they run the complete ROS 2 system, **Then** they can control the simulated humanoid robot using Python agents

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a ROS 2 node fails to connect to the network?
- How does the system handle malformed URDF files?
- What occurs when Python agents send invalid control commands to the robot?
- How are conflicts handled when multiple nodes try to publish to the same topic?
