# Create Constitution for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book

## User Prompt

```
/sp.constitution
Project: Unified Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics with Integrated RAG Chatbot
Core principles:
Accuracy through verification of technical concepts and tools
Clarity for educational audience (students with AI background)
Reproducibility (all code, simulations, and deployments documented and executable)
Rigor (use of industry-standard tools and best practices in robotics and AI)
Key standards:
All technical claims and examples must be traceable to official documentation or sources
Citation format: Markdown with hyperlinks for online resources
Source types: minimum 50% official documentation from tools like ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, OpenAI, etc.
Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance; all content original or properly attributed
Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10 for accessibility
Constraints:
Structure: Follow quarter overview with 4 modules, plus capstone project section
Tools: Must use Docusaurus for book creation, GitHub Pages for deployment, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier for RAG chatbot
Content focus: AI Systems in the Physical World, Embodied Intelligence; bridging digital AI to physical robotics
Chatbot integration: Embedded in the book, capable of answering questions on book content and user-selected text
Success criteria:
Book successfully deployed to GitHub Pages with functional navigation and search
RAG chatbot operational, accurately responding to queries based on book content
All modules covered with practical examples, simulations, and code snippets
Passes functionality tests: chatbot handles voice commands, path planning, and object manipulation in simulations
```

## Assistant Response

Created a complete constitution for the "Unified Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics with Integrated RAG Chatbot" project with the following core principles:

1. Accuracy through verification of technical concepts and tools
2. Clarity for educational audience (students with AI background)
3. Reproducibility (all code, simulations, and deployments documented and executable)
4. Rigor (use of industry-standard tools and best practices in robotics and AI)
5. Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance; all content original or properly attributed
6. Integrated RAG Chatbot Functionality

The constitution includes sections on Technical Standards and Tooling, Book Structure and Content Requirements, and Governance rules. The file `.specify/memory/constitution.md` has been updated with version 1.0.0, ratified on 2025-12-10.

## Outcome

The project constitution has been successfully created and populated with the specified principles and requirements. This constitution will guide the development of the unified book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, ensuring all work follows the established principles for accuracy, clarity, reproducibility, rigor, and proper attribution.
