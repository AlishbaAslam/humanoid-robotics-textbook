## Prompt

"Fix my sidebars.js file according to my docs modules."

## Response snapshot

Updated the sidebars.js file to properly reflect the documentation module structure. The changes included:

1. Adding missing intro files for each module (module-1-ros2/intro, etc.)
2. Using autogenerated directory structures for all modules to ensure all content is properly reflected
3. Maintaining proper hierarchical organization of modules and chapters
4. The sidebar now properly navigates to all documentation content including intro files and all chapters

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed navigation structure to properly reflect all documentation modules
- 🧪 Tests: Manual verification that sidebar navigation works correctly
- 📁 Files: website/sidebars.js updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: None needed - navigation structure now complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Using autogenerated directory structures is more maintainable than hardcoded navigation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - changes improved consistency
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - navigation structure now complete
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
