# Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

# Response

Generated tasks.md file for the ROS 2 middleware feature based on the design documents (spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, research.md, contracts/). The tasks are organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

# Outcome

Successfully created tasks.md file with 42 tasks organized across 6 phases:
- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (9 tasks)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (7 tasks)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (5 tasks)
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (13 tasks)

# Evaluation

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable. The directory structure follows the flat organization requirement with chapters in separate directories without nested subdirectories.
