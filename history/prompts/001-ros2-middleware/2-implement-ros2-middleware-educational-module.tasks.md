# Prompt

```
The Docusaurus project is already initialized. You must use the existing project structure instead of creating a new one. You are also connected to Context7 MCP server use it to fetch the latest Docusaurus documentation, config references, and best-practice guidelines whenever needed. Implement the requested functionality directly inside the initialized Docusaurus project using accurate and up-to-date information from Context7.
```

# Response

Successfully implemented the complete "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" educational module with 42 tasks across 3 user stories:

**Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks)**
- Created project structure for ROS 2 educational module
- Created chapter directories and index.md files

**Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks)**
- Created ROS 2 installation and environment setup guide
- Set up basic ROS 2 workspace structure
- Created common ROS 2 message types and service definitions
- Created foundational ROS 2 concepts introduction
- Set up common Python imports and ROS 2 initialization patterns

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals (9 tasks)**
- Created comprehensive chapter 1 content on ROS 2 fundamentals
- Implemented basic publisher, subscriber, and service examples
- Created exercise 1 on basic nodes
- Added detailed explanations with diagrams for Nodes, Topics, and Services

**Phase 4: User Story 2 - Python Agent Integration (7 tasks)**
- Created chapter 2 content on Python agent integration
- Implemented Python agent, sensor subscriber, and control publisher
- Created exercise 2 on Python integration
- Added rclpy integration concepts and error handling

**Phase 5: User Story 3 - Humanoid Robot Modeling (5 tasks)**
- Created chapter 3 content on URDF modeling
- Created simple humanoid robot URDF
- Created exercise 3 on URDF modeling
- Added comprehensive URDF modeling concepts
- Implemented complete ROS 2 system integration example

**Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (13 tasks)**
- Added citations to official ROS 2 documentation
- Added diagrams and visual aids
- Created comprehensive quickstart guide
- Added troubleshooting section
- Added code formatting and linting
- Reviewed content for readability
- Ran complete validation

All tasks have been completed and marked as [X] in the tasks.md file. The educational module now includes:
- 3 comprehensive chapters with detailed explanations
- Multiple Python examples and exercises
- URDF models and visualization examples
- Complete integration examples combining all concepts
- Test files following TDD approach
- Hands-on exercises for practical learning

# Outcome

The complete ROS 2 educational module has been successfully implemented in the Docusaurus documentation site. The module covers fundamental ROS 2 concepts, Python agent integration, and URDF modeling with practical examples and exercises. All content follows the flat directory structure requirement with chapters in separate directories without nested subdirectories.

# Evaluation

The implementation successfully achieved all objectives:
- Created comprehensive educational content for ROS 2 fundamentals
- Implemented Python agent integration examples with proper error handling
- Developed URDF modeling content with practical examples
- All code examples are executable and follow ROS 2 best practices
- Content is structured for beginner to intermediate robotics developers
- All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as done
- The module enables readers to build and run a simple ROS 2-based robot simulation
