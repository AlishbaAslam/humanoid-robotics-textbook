## Prompt

All content for module 3 must be placed directly in the folder: website/docs/module-3-name/chapter-1-name.
Do not create any subfolders and files inside chapter-1-name. Keep everything in this single folder. Follow the same rules: All content for Chapter 2 and 3 must be directly in chapter-2, and cahpter 3 with no subfolders or nested structures.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for the AI-Robot Brain educational module with 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (Isaac Sim), User Story 2 (Isaac ROS), User Story 3 (Nav2), and Integration & Polish. The tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. All content will be organized in the required directory structure with no nested folders within chapter directories as specified. Also created a quality checklist to validate the task list completeness.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task list created for AI-Robot Brain educational module
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks validated against quality criteria checklist
- 📁 Files: tasks.md and tasks checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase (/sp.implement)
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority with proper dependencies

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All task requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase
