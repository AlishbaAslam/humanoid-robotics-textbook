## Prompt

Educational Module on The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Target audience: Robotics engineers and AI developers building autonomous systems
Focus: Advanced perception, training, and navigation using NVIDIA tools
Success criteria:

Covers 2-3 chapters with practical explanations and examples
Explains key technical concepts with diagrams or pseudocode where helpful
Reader can describe how to integrate these tools for robot development after reading
All technical claims backed by NVIDIA documentation or examples
Constraints:
Word count: 2000-4000 words total
Format: Markdown source, with headings for chapters and sub-sections
Sources: Official NVIDIA documentation and open-source repos, published within past 5 years
Timeline: Complete within 1 week
Not building:
Full software implementation or code repository
Hardware setup guides or physical robot assembly
Broader AI ethics or societal impact discussions
Comparisons to non-NVIDIA robotics platforms

Chapters:

NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation
Isaac ROS: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM and Navigation
Nav2: Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoid Movement

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the AI-Robot Brain educational module covering NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2. The specification includes three prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios, functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015), key entities, and measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-009). Also created a quality checklist to validate the specification completeness. The spec targets robotics engineers and AI developers, focusing on advanced perception, training, and navigation using NVIDIA tools.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification created for AI-Robot Brain educational module
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality criteria checklist
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all three chapters with clear user value

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All specification requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
