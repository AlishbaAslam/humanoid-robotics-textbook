## Prompt

Create: book architecture sketch, chapter structure, research approach, quality validation.
Decisions needing documentation: list important choices with options and tradeoffs, such as tool selections, content depth, and deployment options.
Testing strategy: validation checks based on acceptance criteria, including content accuracy, reproducibility tests, and user feedback simulations.
Technical details:

Use spec-driven development with concurrent research and writing
Follow markdown formatting compatible with Docusaurus
Organize by phases: Planning → Content Creation → Integration → Deployment

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the AI-Robot Brain educational module covering architecture overview, key decisions with tradeoffs, implementation phases, technical approach, research methodology, book architecture, testing strategy, and risk mitigation. The plan includes five phases: Setup and Foundation (P1), Isaac Sim Content (P1), Isaac ROS Content (P2), Nav2 Content (P3), and Integration and Polish (P2). Also created a quality checklist to validate the plan completeness.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan created for AI-Robot Brain educational module
- 🧪 Tests: Plan validated against quality criteria checklist
- 📁 Files: plan.md and plan checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task creation phase (/sp.tasks)
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all architectural and technical requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All planning requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task creation phase
