## Prompt

**Goal:** Generate exactly **ONE PAGE ONLY** of output for the "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" specification.
**Hard rule:** Output must never exceed **one page** (≈ 300–400 words).

---

### Task 1 — One-Paragraph Project Summary
Produce **one single paragraph** (5–6 sentences max) explaining the project's purpose, target users, core features, and value.
No extra sections. No long text.

---

### Task 2 — One-Page Feature + Structure Block
Create a **single compact block** containing:
- **Max 8 features** (each one sentence)
- **A tiny site map** (max 8 items, each 3–5 words)
- **A short weekly plan** (4 weeks, each with 2 bullets)
All combined must still fit within the single-page limit.

---

### Task 3 — Final One-Page Assembly
Assemble everything into **ONE PAGE** with this order only:
1. Summary paragraph
2. Features list
3. Site map
4. Weekly plan
No additional commentary, no expansions, no tables.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks for the "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook chapter. The response includes:

1. A complete task breakdown organized by user stories and phases
2. A one-page chapter content that meets all the user's requirements:
   - A concise summary paragraph explaining the project
   - 8 core features of the chapter
   - A site map with 5 key sections
   - A weekly plan with 4 time periods covering the 13-week course

The chapter content was created at src/content/docs/physical-ai-intro/introduction.md and includes all required elements while maintaining the one-page constraint.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task list and one-page chapter content
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks validation and execution checklist completed
- 📁 Files: tasks.md, execution checklist, and chapter content created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase (/sp.implement)
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories for independent execution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All validation criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase
