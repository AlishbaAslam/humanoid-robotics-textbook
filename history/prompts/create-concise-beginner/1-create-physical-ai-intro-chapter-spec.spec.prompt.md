## Prompt

Create a concise, beginner-friendly "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" chapter for my textbook.

Target audience: Students starting a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
Focus: Embodied intelligence, ROS 2, Simulation (Gazebo & Unity), NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action robotics.

Success criteria:
- Extremely concise (1 page equivalent).
- Clear explanation of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.
- High-level module summaries: ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA.
- Includes a short "Why Physical AI Matters" section.
- Includes a short "What Students Will Learn" section.
- Includes a **clear, concise Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1–13)** with 1–2 bullets per week.
- Includes a short Capstone description.
- Keep all content simple, structured, and easy to read.
- Format: clean headings + short paragraphs + bullet points.
- No long explanations; summarize only.

Source data to cover (summarize only):
- Physical AI definition & course theme
- Module 1: ROS 2
- Module 2: Gazebo & Unity
- Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
- Module 4: VLA robotics
- Learning outcomes
- Weekly breakdown (Weeks 1–13)
- Capstone project: Autonomous Humanoid
- Importance of Physical AI

Constraint: Highly concise, clean formatting, student-friendly language.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook chapter. The specification includes:

- User stories for students accessing the introductory content
- Functional requirements covering all specified content areas
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- A quality checklist to validate the specification
- Proper formatting and structure for the textbook chapter

The specification addresses all requirements from the user, including Physical AI definition, course modules (ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA), weekly breakdown, capstone project, and student learning outcomes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete spec for Physical AI textbook chapter
- 🧪 Tests: Spec validation and requirement checklist completed
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers all required elements with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All validation criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
