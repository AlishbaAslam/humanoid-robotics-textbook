## Prompt

Create a single, concise, one-page chapter titled "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".

## Objectives
- Produce exactly ONE page of content.
- Summarize Physical AI, embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, and course purpose.
- Include module overview, weekly breakdown summary, learning outcomes, and capstone in short form.
- Maintain a clean academic tone suitable for a textbook.

## Page Structure
1. Title + Short Definition
   - What is Physical AI?
   - What is embodied intelligence?
   - Why humanoid robotics?

2. Course Theme
   - Bridge digital AI to physical robots
   - What students will accomplish this quarter

3. Module Overview (Super-brief)
   - Module 1: ROS 2
   - Module 2: Gazebo + Unity
   - Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
   - Module 4: VLA (Vision-Language-Action)

4. Learning Outcomes
   - 6–8 bullet points only

5. Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1–13)
   - One-line bullets per week group
   - Must fit into one page

6. Capstone Summary
   - 2–3 lines max
   - "Autonomous Humanoid" description

## Content Strategy
- Compress all ideas from source content into minimal, high-impact text.
- Use bullet lists to ensure one-page limit.
- Avoid hardware details, lab architecture, or cost tables.
- Keep explanations beginner-friendly but accurate.
- Use uniform formatting for Docusaurus-friendly output.

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Page fits within one-screen / one-page equivalent.
- [ ] No section exceeds 3–4 lines.
- [ ] All modules included.
- [ ] Weekly breakdown is present but minimal.
- [ ] Capstone is clear and concise.
- [ ] No technical jargon without context.
- [ ] Tone stays educational and smooth.

## Decisions to Document
1. **Level of Detail:**
   - Chosen: Highly concise (one page).
   - Rejected: Full chapter with hardware and deep engineering detail.

2. **Formatting Style:**
   - Chosen: Short sections + bullets.
   - Rejected: Long paragraphs and multi-page explanations.

3. **Weekly Breakdown Granularity:**
   - Chosen: Summary-level (weeks grouped).
   - Rejected: Detailed weekly syllabi.

## Deliverable
A polished, ONE-PAGE markdown chapter ready to be placed inside the Docusaurus "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" directory.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive architecture plan for the "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook chapter. The plan includes:

- Architecture decisions for content structure, technical detail level, and integration format
- Implementation approach focusing on content-first methodology
- Key components and interfaces for the chapter content
- Non-functional requirements for performance, usability, and maintainability
- Risk analysis for content, educational, and integration aspects

The plan addresses all requirements from the user, including one-page constraint, beginner-friendly language, and Docusaurus compatibility.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete architecture plan for Physical AI textbook chapter
- 🧪 Tests: Plan validation and architecture checklist completed
- 📁 Files: plan.md and architecture checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation phase (/sp.tasks)
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan provides clear architectural guidance for content creation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All validation criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation phase
