## Prompt

The Docusaurus project is already initialized. You must use the existing project structure instead of creating a new one. You are also connected to Context7 MCP server use it to fetch the latest Docusaurus documentation, config references, and best-practice guidelines whenever needed. Implement the requested functionality directly inside the initialized Docusaurus project using accurate and up-to-date information from Context7.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" chapter for the Docusaurus documentation site. The implementation includes:

1. Created a comprehensive one-page chapter at `website/docs/physical-ai-intro/introduction.md` with all required sections:
   - Clear definitions of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
   - Course theme and objectives
   - Module overviews for ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA
   - "Why Physical AI Matters" section
   - Learning outcomes with 8 bullet points
   - Weekly breakdown for Weeks 1-13
   - Capstone project summary

2. All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as done:
   - Setup phase tasks (T001-T003)
   - Foundational phase tasks (T004-T006)
   - User Story 1 tasks (T007-T015)
   - User Story 2 tasks (T016-T018)
   - User Story 3 tasks (T019-T021)
   - Polish phase tasks (T022-T026)

3. The content fits within a single page while maintaining readability and academic tone
4. Content is formatted appropriately for Docusaurus compatibility with proper frontmatter
5. All content is beginner-friendly with accessible explanations

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Physical AI textbook chapter implemented
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks completed, content validated
- 📁 Files: Chapter content and updated tasks file created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for documentation integration
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation follows Docusaurus best practices and meets all specification requirements
