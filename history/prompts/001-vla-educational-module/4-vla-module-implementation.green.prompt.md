prompt_text: "The Docusaurus project is already initialized. You must use the existing project structure instead of creating a new one. You are also connected to Context7 MCP server use it to fetch the latest Docusaurus documentation, config references, and best-practice guidelines whenever needed. Implement the requested functionality directly inside the initialized Docusaurus project using accurate and up-to-date information from Context7."
response_text: "Successfully implemented the VLA Educational Module with 3 comprehensive chapters covering Voice-to-Action, Cognitive Planning, and Capstone Project. Created detailed documentation with code examples, Mermaid diagrams, and practical exercises. Integrated the module into the Docusaurus sidebar and validated all content against official documentation from OpenAI Whisper, ROS 2, and VLA systems."
outcome: "VLA Educational Module successfully implemented with all 4 user stories completed. The module covers Vision-Language-Action systems with practical examples and implementation guidance for robotics engineers and AI developers."
evaluation: "The implementation meets all requirements from the specification with comprehensive content covering all 3 required chapters. Content is technically accurate, includes practical examples, and follows Docusaurus best practices."
