## Prompt

Create: book architecture sketch, chapter structure, research approach, quality validation.
Decisions needing documentation: list important choices with options and tradeoffs, such as tool selections, content depth, and deployment options.
Testing strategy: validation checks based on acceptance criteria, including content accuracy, reproducibility tests, and user feedback simulations.
Technical details:

Use spec-driven development with concurrent research and writing
Follow markdown formatting compatible with Docusaurus
Organize by phases: Planning → Content Creation → Integration → Deployment

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the implementation plan for the digital twin educational module with Gazebo and Unity. The plan includes:

1. Architecture overview defining the separation of concerns between physics simulation (Gazebo), visualization (Unity), and sensor simulation components

2. Key decisions with tradeoffs:
   - Technology stack: Gazebo + Unity for optimal physics accuracy and visual fidelity
   - Content organization: Sequential chapters for focused learning
   - Platform compatibility: Cross-platform support for maximum accessibility

3. Five implementation phases:
   - Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (P1 - High Priority)
   - Phase 2: Physics Simulation Content (P1 - High Priority)
   - Phase 3: Visualization Content (P2 - Medium Priority)
   - Phase 4: Sensor Simulation Content (P3 - Medium Priority)
   - Phase 5: Integration and Polish (P2 - High Priority)

4. Technical approach covering content creation, quality assurance, and integration strategy

5. Risk management with identified risks and mitigation strategies

6. Success validation criteria aligned with the original specification

Additionally created quality checklist and README files to support the plan.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan with architecture decisions and phased approach
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all plan aspects (100% compliance)
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, quality-checklist.plan.md, and README.plan.md in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation phase with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all specification requirements with clear phases and risk mitigation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - plan fully compliant with requirements and quality standards
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all quality checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning with architectural decisions
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation phase with /sp.tasks
