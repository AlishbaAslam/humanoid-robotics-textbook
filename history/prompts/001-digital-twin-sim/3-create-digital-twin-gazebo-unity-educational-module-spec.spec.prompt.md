## Prompt

Educational Module on The Digital Twin using Gazebo and Unity
Target audience: Robotics students and engineers learning simulation tools for robot development
Focus: Building digital twins with physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering in Unity, including sensor simulations; structured into 2-3 chapters covering core concepts and practical applications
Success criteria:

Includes 2-3 chapters: 1) Physics Simulation and Environment Building in Gazebo, 2) High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity, 3) Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) and Integration
Provides hands-on tutorials with code examples and step-by-step guides
Cites 5+ relevant technical resources or documentation
Learner can set up a basic digital twin simulation after completing the module
All explanations supported by diagrams or screenshots

Constraints:

Word count per chapter: 1500-2500 words
Format: Markdown with code blocks, including setup instructions for Gazebo and Unity
Sources: Official documentation from ROS/Gazebo, Unity manuals, and open-source robotics papers from the past 5 years
Timeline: Complete within 1 week

Not building:

Full robotics course beyond simulation tools
Comparisons of alternative simulators like Webots or Isaac Sim
In-depth hardware integration or real-world deployment guides
Advanced AI/ML components in simulations

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the complete specification for the educational module on "The Digital Twin using Gazebo and Unity". The specification includes:

1. Three prioritized user stories:
   - User Story 1 (P1): Physics Simulation and Environment Building in Gazebo
   - User Story 2 (P2): High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity
   - User Story 3 (P3): Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) and Integration

2. Each user story includes:
   - Clear description in plain language
   - Priority level and rationale
   - Independent test description
   - Acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format

3. Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-011) covering:
   - Installation and setup tutorials
   - Documentation for simulation environments
   - Hands-on exercises with code examples
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Citations and visual aids

4. Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) including:
   - Installation success rates
   - Learning outcomes
   - Content quality metrics
   - Technical requirements

5. Quality checklist and README files created to support the specification

The specification fully addresses all requirements from the user's feature description including the 2-3 chapters structure, hands-on tutorials, code examples, citations to technical resources, and visual aids.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for digital twin educational module with Gazebo and Unity
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all specification aspects (100% compliance)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md, quality-checklist.md, and README.md in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all user requirements with clear user stories and measurable success criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification fully compliant with template and requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all quality checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase with /sp.plan
