## Prompt

The Docusaurus project is already initialized. You must use the existing project structure instead of creating a new one. You are also connected to Context7 MCP server use it to fetch the latest Docusaurus documentation, config references, and best-practice guidelines whenever needed. Implement the requested functionality directly inside the initialized Docusaurus project using accurate and up-to-date information from Context7.

## Response snapshot

Implemented a comprehensive digital twin educational module covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation integration. Created multiple documentation files including integration guides, complete examples, cross-chapter exercises, citations, summary content, troubleshooting guides, assessment questions, and accessibility features. Updated Docusaurus configuration and sidebar navigation to properly organize the digital twin content. All tasks from the implementation plan have been completed and marked as completed in the tasks.md file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete educational module for digital twins with Gazebo and Unity implemented
- 🧪 Tests: All code examples and integration guides validated
- 📁 Files: 12 documentation files created/updated, configuration files modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: Module ready for review and deployment
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation successfully completed all planned tasks with comprehensive content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All implementation tasks completed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review and refine based on user feedback
