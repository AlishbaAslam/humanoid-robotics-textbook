$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task list for the digital twin educational module with Gazebo and Unity. The tasks are organized into 6 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T004) - Project initialization and structure
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (T005-T010) - Cross-cutting concerns and research
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** (T011-T020) - Gazebo physics simulation content (P1 priority)
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** (T021-T030) - Unity visualization content (P2 priority)
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** (T031-T040) - Sensor simulation content (P3 priority)
6. **Phase 6: Integration and Polish** (T041-T050) - Final integration and quality assurance

Each task follows the required format with proper checkboxes, sequential IDs, parallelization flags [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. The tasks align with the specification requirements including:
- 3 chapters covering Gazebo physics, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation
- Hands-on tutorials with code examples
- Installation guides for different platforms
- Diagrams and screenshots for visual learning
- Citations to official documentation
- Cross-platform compatibility

Quality checklist and README files were also created to support the task execution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task breakdown with 50 specific tasks organized by phase and priority
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all tasks format and completeness (100% compliance)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md, quality-checklist.tasks.md, and README.tasks.md in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are specific enough for execution and organized to enable independent development of user stories

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - tasks fully compliant with format and requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all quality checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation from spec and plan
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase with /sp.implement
