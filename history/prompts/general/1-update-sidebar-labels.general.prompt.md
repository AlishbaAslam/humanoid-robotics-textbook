# Update Sidebar Labels

## Context
Updated the sidebar labels in the documentation site to better reflect the content of the humanoid robotics textbook.

## Changes Made
1. Updated label 1: "Introduction" → "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
2. Updated label 2: "Module 1: ROS2 Middleware" → "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)"
3. Updated label 3: "Module 2: Digital Twin using Gazebo and Unity" → "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
4. Updated label 4: "Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" → "Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)"
5. Verified label 5: "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" was already correct

## Additional Fix
Fixed a syntax error in the original file where there was an improperly structured object that was not part of the tutorialSidebar array. The Module 4 section has been properly integrated into the tutorialSidebar array.

## Result
The sidebar now has a clean, consistent structure with the new module titles that better reflect the content of your humanoid robotics textbook. The file is syntactically correct and should work properly with Docusaurus.
