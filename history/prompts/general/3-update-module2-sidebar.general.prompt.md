## Prompt

"In sidebars.js Add 'module-2-digital-twin' to Docusaurus structure.

  Pages required:
  1. Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)  (*ONLY * Here is dropdown option)
  2. Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
  3. Chapter 1: Physics Simulation and Environment Building in Gazebo
  4. Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity
  5. Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) and Integration

  All pages must be in docs/module-2-digital-twin.
  Only 'Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)' is a dropdown; others flat.
  Sidebar must list these 5 items in order with no categories and just one dropdowns.
  No extra pages."

## Response snapshot

Updated website/sidebars.js to replace the autogenerated Module 2 structure with specific flat pages as requested. Changed from using 'type: 'autogenerated'' to explicitly listing the 4 required pages under the 'Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)' dropdown category.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated sidebar to explicitly show Module 2 pages instead of using autogenerated structure
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated sidebars.js to modify Module 2 structure
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Changed from autogenerated to explicit page listing for better control over page order and visibility
