# Create ROS 2 Middleware Plan

## User Prompt

```
Create: book architecture sketch, chapter structure, research approach, quality validation.
Decisions needing documentation: list important choices with options and tradeoffs, such as tool selections, content depth, and deployment options.
Testing strategy: validation checks based on acceptance criteria, including content accuracy, reproducibility tests, and user feedback simulations.
Technical details:

Use spec-driven development with concurrent research and writing
Follow markdown formatting compatible with Docusaurus
Organize by phases: Planning → Content Creation → Integration → Deployment
```

## Assistant Response

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" module with:

- Detailed technical context including language versions, dependencies, and constraints
- Constitution check ensuring compliance with project principles
- Project structure with clear organization for documentation and content
- Research document covering key decisions on ROS 2 distribution, Python compatibility, content depth, simulation environment, and exercise structure
- Data model defining key entities for ROS 2 nodes, publishers, subscribers, services, URDF models, and Python agents
- Quickstart guide with environment setup, example execution, and troubleshooting
- Contract definitions for ROS 2 services and topics that will be demonstrated in the educational content

All artifacts created in the specs/001-ros2-middleware/ directory following the project structure requirements.

## Outcome

The implementation plan is complete and ready for the next phase (tasks creation). The plan includes all required research, data modeling, and contract definitions needed to implement the ROS 2 educational module according to the project's constitution and specifications.
