# Create ROS 2 Middleware Tasks

## User Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Assistant Response

Created a comprehensive task list for implementing "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" educational module with:

- 5 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals), User Story 2 (Python Agent Integration), User Story 3 (URDF Modeling), and Integration/Final Simulation
- 55 total tasks with proper IDs, parallelization markers, and user story labels
- Each task includes specific file paths and clear descriptions
- Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Dependencies and execution order clearly defined
- Implementation strategy for MVP-first, incremental delivery, and parallel team work
- Tasks follow the required checklist format: checkbox, ID, labels, file paths

The task list covers all requirements from the specification including 3 chapters, 2-3 exercises per chapter, code examples, official documentation citations, and a complete simulation.

## Outcome

The tasks are complete and ready for implementation. The task list enables independent development of each user story while maintaining proper dependencies and ensuring all requirements from the specification are met.
