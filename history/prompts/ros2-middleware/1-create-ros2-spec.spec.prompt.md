# Create ROS 2 Middleware Specification

## User Prompt

```
The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Target audience: Beginner to intermediate robotics developers and AI engineers learning to integrate software agents with robot hardware
Focus: Middleware for robot control, including ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services; Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy; Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids. Structure the module into 3 chapters: Chapter 1 - Fundamentals of ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services; Chapter 2 - Integrating Python Agents with ROS 2 via rclpy; Chapter 3 - Modeling Humanoid Robots with URDF
Success criteria:

Explains core ROS 2 concepts with practical examples and code snippets
Includes 2-3 hands-on exercises per chapter with step-by-step guidance
Cites 5+ official ROS documentation or reputable tutorials
Reader can build and run a simple ROS 2-based robot simulation after completing the module
All technical claims backed by references or verifiable code

Weekly Breakdown: Weeks 3-5

Week 3: Complete Chapter 1 - Fundamentals of ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services, including all exercises
Week 4: Complete Chapter 2 - Integrating Python Agents with ROS 2 via rclpy, including all exercises
Week 5: Complete Chapter 3 - Modeling Humanoid Robots with URDF, including all exercises and final simulation build

Constraints:

Word count: 2000-4000 words total across chapters
Format: Markdown with code blocks, diagrams (using Mermaid or ASCII art), and inline links
Sources: Official ROS 2 documentation, open-source tutorials, published within past 5 years
Timeline: Complete within 1 week

Not building:

In-depth hardware-specific integrations or custom robot builds
Advanced ROS 2 extensions like DDS or security features
Ethical discussions on robotics (separate module)
Full-scale project implementations or deployment guides
```

## Assistant Response

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" module with:

- Three user stories prioritized by importance (P1-P3)
- Clear acceptance scenarios for each user story
- Edge case considerations
- Ten functional requirements covering all aspects of the module
- Four key entities defined (ROS 2 Node, Topic, Service, rclpy, URDF, Python Agent)
- Eight measurable success criteria

The specification is structured into three chapters as requested:
1. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
2. Chapter 2: Integrating Python Agents with ROS 2 via rclpy
3. Chapter 3: Modeling Humanoid Robots with URDF

A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.

## Outcome

The ROS 2 middleware specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. The specification meets all requirements and is structured to guide the development of educational content for beginner to intermediate robotics developers and AI engineers.
